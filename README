Hangman game to word guess
___________________________________________________________________________
🛠️ How It Works:
Picks a random word from WORD_LIST.
Displays underscores (_) for the word’s length.
Allows player to guess letters or the whole word.
Incorrect guesses reduce remaining attempts and update the hangman drawing.
Ends when the player guesses correctly or runs out of attempts.
